# COMC-1745: Web Design & Technologies

This class's objective was to build a modern responsive website (Front-End).  
It started with the project planning and creating a mock-up using a Miro board.  
Then I created the first iteration using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ex2b).  
Afterwards, I was tasked to modify the code and incorporate Bootstrap into the project (ex2d).  
The final iteration was to build upon the previous designs keeping the UX/UI in mind (ex2f).
